# Proving Grounds Play

This section contains writeups for Proving Grounds Play machines, organized by <mark style="color:blue;">**Linux**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**Windows**</mark> & <mark style="color:blue;">**Active Directory**</mark> categories. These machines are generally more realistic and less CTF-like than those found on platforms like Hack The Box, with a focus that's closer to what you'd see in the OSCP Exam.
