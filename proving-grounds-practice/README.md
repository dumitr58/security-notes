# Proving Grounds Practice

This section contains writeups for Proving Grounds Practice machines, organized by [<mark style="color:blue;">**Linux**</mark>](linux/), [<mark style="color:blue;">**Windows**</mark> ](windows/)& [<mark style="color:blue;">**Active Directory**</mark>](active-directory/) categories. These machines are generally more realistic and less CTF-like than those found on platforms like Hack The Box, with a focus that's closer to what you'd see in the OSCP Exam.
