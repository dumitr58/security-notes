Security researcher, Builder, Breaker

Curiosity driven since age 9, reverse-engineering home computers, breaking things just to see why the broke. Obsession turned profession.

First live exploit: SQL injection on a school team's built login form during a class demo. Dumped the full MySQL database mid presentation. No one saw it coming, including the target

Hands on with real labs and real targets HTB, Proving Grounds, THM, Home Labs. Focused on web app exploitation, Active Directory attacks, privilege escalation, buffer overflows, and post-exploitation. Anything exploitable gets explored.

Studied toward OSCP through Offensive Security Labs, coursework, months of hands-on experience documented in 200+ writeups

This notebook documents the grind, offensive security techniques, failed exploits, successful breaches, writeups, tools and lessons learned the hard way. Inspired by the community, built to give back!

Break things! Understand them! Get better!
